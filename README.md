  ## Description

  This application allows a user to view their entire employee directory at once so that they have quick access to their information. Given a table of employees, when the user loads the page, the entire directory appears. The user can sort the table alphabetically by name or filter the users by name in the search form.

  This application is an employee directory created with React. To create the project I had to break up the application's UI into components, manage component states, and respond to user events.

  The React Employee Directory is fully mobile-optimized!
